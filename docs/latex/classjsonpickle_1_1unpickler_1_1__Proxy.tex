\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Proxies are dummy objects that are later replaced by real instances

The `restore()` function has to solve a tricky problem when pickling
objects with cyclical references -- the parent instance does not yet
exist.

The problem is that `__getnewargs__()`, `__getstate__()`, custom handlers,
and cyclical objects graphs are allowed to reference the yet-to-be-created
object via the referencing machinery.

In other words, objects are allowed to depend on themselves for
construction!

We solve this problem by placing dummy Proxy objects into the referencing
machinery so that we can construct the child objects before constructing
the parent.  Objects are initially created with Proxy attribute values
instead of real references.

We collect all objects that contain references to proxies and run
a final sweep over them to swap in the real instance.  This is done
at the very end of the top-level `restore()`.

The `instance` attribute below is replaced with the real instance
after `__new__()` has been used to construct the object and is used
when swapping proxies with real instances.\end{DoxyVerb}
